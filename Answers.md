1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a User Interface library. It solves the problem of getting the correct data to the correct place in large and complex applications. 

1. What does it mean to think in react?

To think in React is to think through what you need to have before breaking it down into smaller parts and making each one work. For example, to break the UI into components, build a static version in react, identify the optimal representation of UI state, identify where state should go and to finally add inverse data flow.

1. Describe state.

State is the current form of a piece of data at one point in your code. 

1. Describe props.

Props refer to the data that you use to pass between components. 

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects manage anything unrelated to the execution of the function. Examples of side effects include, timers, retrieving data from an API and manually manipulating the DOM.
